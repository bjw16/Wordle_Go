Wordle in Golang

Go based wordle clone I used to learn Golang.

Essentially, I converted the game to command line using just ASCII.

Players have 6 guesses to guess correct 5 letter word.

Guess is color coded if the following:
- Green if letter in guess is in the same index as answer
- Yellow if letter is in word but not at index


Run game:
  go run wordle.go
